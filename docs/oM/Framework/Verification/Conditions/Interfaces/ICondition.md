## Code and Schema

### C# implementation

``` C# title="C#"
public interface ICondition : BH.oM.Base.IObject
```

Assembly: Verification_oM.dll

The interface is defined in C#. The class definition is available on github:

- [ICondition.cs](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/develop/Verification_oM/Conditions\Interfaces\ICondition.cs)

All history and changes of the class can be found by inspection the history.
### JSON Schema implementation

The object is defined as a JSON schema. To reference the schema in a validator like [this](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/) to validate a Json instance, please use the lines below:

``` json title="JSON Schema"
{
 "$ref" : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/develop/Verification_oM/Conditions/ICondition.json}
```

The JSON Schema is available on github here:

- [ICondition.json](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/blob/develop/Verification_oM/Conditions/ICondition.json)
