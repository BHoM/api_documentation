title: BoundingBox
---

# <small>BH.oM.Geometry.</small>**BoundingBox**

An axis aligned cuboid, which describes the smallest volume Box, oriented with the global coordinate system, that fully encompases a set of geometry.
Defined by its two extreme corner Points, these six coordinate values of Min and Max X, Y and Z are combined to specify all eight Box corners.

    -  BH.oM.Base.[IObject](/api/oM/Framework/Base/Interface/IObject)


## Properties



### Defining properties

The following properties are defined on the class

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Min | [Point](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Vector/Point) | The lower bound values for the X, Y and Z coordinates of the Box corner Points. | - |
| Max | [Point](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Vector/Point) | The upper bound values for the X, Y and Z coordinates of the Box corner Points. | - |


### Derived properties

The following properties are defined as extension methods in one of the BHoM_Engines
