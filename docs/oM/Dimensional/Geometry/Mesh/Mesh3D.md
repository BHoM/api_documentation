| Faces | [IReadOnlyList](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList-1?view=netstandard-2.0)&lt;[Face](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Mesh/Face)&gt; | The list of polygons, defined as corner Point indices referencing the list of Vertices. | - |
| CellRelation | [IReadOnlyList](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList-1?view=netstandard-2.0)&lt;[CellRelation](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Mesh/CellRelation)&gt; | A parallel list to the Faces, details the index of the cells which is behind and infront of each Face. | - |


### Derived properties

The following properties are defined as extension methods in one of the BHoM_Engines

| IBounds | [BoundingBox](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Misc/BoundingBox) | Returns the global world axis oriented enclosing BoundingBox for all points of the geometry, i.e. the box with the smallest volume within which all the points on the geometry lie. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IHashArray | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0)[] | Returns a signature of the input geometry, useful for distance-based comparisons and diffing.<br>The hash is computed as an array representing the coordinate of significant points taken on the geometry.<br>The number of points is reduced to the minimum essential to determine uniquely any geometry.<br>Additionally, the resulting points are transformed based on the source geometry type, to remove or minimize collisions.<br>(Any transformation so performed is translational only, in order to support geometrical tolerance, i.e. numerical distance, when comparing GeometryHashes downstream). | - | Geometry_Engine |

## Code and Schema

### C# implementation

``` C# title="C#"
public class Mesh3D : BH.oM.Geometry.IGeometry, BH.oM.Base.IObject, BH.oM.Base.IImmutable
```

Assembly: Geometry_oM.dll

The C# class definition is available on github:

- [Mesh3D.cs](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/develop/Geometry_oM/Mesh\Mesh3D.cs)

All history and changes of the class can be found by inspection the history.
### JSON Schema implementation

The object is defined as a JSON schema. You can validate a JSON instance against this schema by refernce. To do this, use the schema reference below in in a validator like [this one](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/).

``` json title="JSON Schema"
{
 "$ref" : "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/develop/Geometry_oM/Mesh3D.json"
}
```

The JSON Schema is available on github here:

- [Mesh3D.json](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/blob/develop/Geometry_oM/Mesh3D.json)
