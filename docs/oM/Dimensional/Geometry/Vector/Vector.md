| IArea | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Calculates the area of the provided geometry. | [Area](/api/oM/Dimensional/Quantities/Attributes/Area) [m²] | Geometry_Engine |
| IBounds | [BoundingBox](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Misc/BoundingBox) | Returns the global world axis oriented enclosing BoundingBox for all points of the geometry, i.e. the box with the smallest volume within which all the points on the geometry lie. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| IHashArray | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0)[] | Returns a signature of the input geometry, useful for distance-based comparisons and diffing.<br>The hash is computed as an array representing the coordinate of significant points taken on the geometry.<br>The number of points is reduced to the minimum essential to determine uniquely any geometry.<br>Additionally, the resulting points are transformed based on the source geometry type, to remove or minimize collisions.<br>(Any transformation so performed is translational only, in order to support geometrical tolerance, i.e. numerical distance, when comparing GeometryHashes downstream). | - | Geometry_Engine |

| IsNull | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | Checks if a Geometry is null and outputs relevant error message. | - | Geometry_Engine |

| LargestComponent | [Vector](/api/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Vector/Vector) | Returns the largest component as determined by one vector, dependent upon which axis is more represented vector. | - | Geometry_Engine |
| Length | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Calculates the length of a Vector. | [Length](/api/oM/Dimensional/Quantities/Attributes/Length) [m] | Geometry_Engine |
| SquareLength | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Calculates the square length of a Vector. Faster to compute than the length and can be usefull for example where only relative lengths between vectors are sought. | - | Geometry_Engine |

### JSON Schema implementation

The object is defined as a JSON schema. You can validate a JSON instance against this schema by reference. To do this, use the schema reference below in a validator like [this one](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/).

``` json title="JSON Schema"
{
 "$ref" : "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BHoM/BHoM_JSONSchema/develop/Geometry_oM/Vector.json"
}
```

The JSON Schema is available on github here:
