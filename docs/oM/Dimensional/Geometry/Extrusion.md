## Properties



### Defining properties

The following properties are defined on the class

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Curve | [ICurve](/om_documentation/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/ICurve) | The Extrusion profile curve defining the constant cross sectional shape. Idential curves can be recreated at any point along the Extrusion axis through intersection with the Surface. | - |
| Direction | [Vector](/om_documentation/oM/Dimensional/Geometry/Vector) | The axis along which to translate the profile curve. The Vector magnitude determining the Extrusion length. | [Length](/om_documentation/oM/Dimensional/Quantities/Attributes/Length) [m] |
| Capped | [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean?view=netstandard-2.0) | Defines the Extrusion as closed and therfore a solid volume. | - |
