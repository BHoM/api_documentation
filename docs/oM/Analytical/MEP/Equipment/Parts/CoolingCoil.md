### Defining properties

The following properties are defined on the class

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| TotalCapacity | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Total capacity indicates the combined sensible and latent capacity of the cooling coil | - |
| SensibleCapacity | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Sensible capacity indicates the ability for the cooling coil to change the temperature (rather than the phase) of the fluid (air). | - |
| EnteringDryBulbAirTemperature | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Entering Dry Bulb Air Temperature indicates the heat intensity of the air entering the system in degrees Celsius, without taking humidity into consideration | - |
| EnteringWetBulbAirTemperature | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Entering Wet Bulb Air Temperature indicates the heat intensity of the air entering the system in degrees Celsius, while taking humidity into consideration | - |
| LeavingDryBulbAirTemperature | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Leaving Dry Bulb Air Temperature indicates the heat intensity of the air leaving the system in degrees Celsius, without taking humidity into consideration | - |
| LeavingWetBulbAirTemperature | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Leaving Wet Bulb Air Temperature indicates the heat intensity of the air leaving the system in degrees Celsius, while taking humidity into consideration | - |
| EnteringWaterTemperature | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Entering Water Temperature indicates the heat intensity of the water entering the system in degrees Celsius | - |
| LeavingWaterTemperature | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Leaving Water Temperature indicates the heat intensity of the water leaving the system in degrees Celsius | - |
| PressureDrop | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Pressure Drop indicates the amount of resistance created by the coil which creates a loss in pressure of the fluid (air) | - |
| NumberOfRows | [int](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Int32?view=netstandard-2.0) | Number of Rows indicates the number of rows of coils that the fluid (air) passes through | - |
