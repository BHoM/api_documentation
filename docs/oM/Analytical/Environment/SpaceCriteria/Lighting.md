## Properties



### Defining properties

The following properties are defined on the class

| Name             | Type             | Description      | Quantity         |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Sensible | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | The sensible heat contributed by light fixtures, which contributes to a rise in temperature with no change in phase. | - |
| Profile | [Profile](/api/oM/Analytical/Environment/SpaceCriteria/Profile) | Profiles depict the time period (hours per day, days per week) during which the lighting gain is contributing heat to the space. | - |
| RadiantFraction | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | The radiant fraction depicts the percentage of long wave radiant heat given off by the light fixtures. | - |
| LuminousEfficacy | [double](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Double?view=netstandard-2.0) | Luminous efficacy is a measure of how well a light fixture produces visible light | - |
